# Appearance

The `style` block controls gaps, borders, opacity, and how fullscreen windows
stack:

```scfg
style {
    gap 8
    border_width 2
    border_active "#296bb8"
    border_inactive "#3a3a3a"
    opacity_active 1.0
    opacity_inactive 1.0
    fullscreen_covers top
}
```

| Key | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gap` | nonnegative integer in logical pixels | `0` |
| `border_width` | nonnegative integer in logical pixels | `0` |
| `corner_radius` | nonnegative integer in logical pixels | `0` |
| `blur` | integer from `0` through `64` | `0` |
| `border_active` | `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` | `#296bb8` |
| `border_inactive` | `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` | `#3a3a3a` |
| `opacity_active` | decimal from `0.0` through `1.0` | `1.0` |
| `opacity_inactive` | decimal from `0.0` through `1.0` | `1.0` |
| `fullscreen_covers` | `none`, `top`, or `overlay` | `top` |

The active and inactive border colors follow keyboard focus. Leme draws the border as its complete server-side decoration. It does not draw titlebars or buttons.

`corner_radius` rounds the window, frame and content together. The value is
clamped to half the shorter side, so a small window keeps the largest radius
that fits. Fullscreen windows are never rounded, because a window covering the
output has nothing to show through its corners.

Rounding requires a build configured with `-Deffects=true`, which compiles
against a patched wlroots. Other builds accept the key and ignore it.

`blur` blurs whatever is behind a window. It is only visible where the window
is translucent, so it does nothing unless `opacity_active` or
`opacity_inactive` is below 1, or the client draws its own transparency.
Behind an opaque window the work is skipped entirely. Fullscreen windows are
never blurred.

A blur radius above 64 is reported rather than clamped, so a value that would
do nothing useful says so instead of being silently reduced.

`blur` needs the same `-Deffects=true` build as `corner_radius`.

A matching window-rule `opacity` replaces the active or inactive style opacity;
the values are not multiplied.

## Fullscreen stacking

`fullscreen_covers` decides which layer-shell surfaces a fullscreen window is
allowed to cover. Panels, bars, and notification daemons are layer-shell
clients, and each one picks the layer it sits on.

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | Layer surfaces stay above fullscreen windows, which are sized to the usable area. |
| `top` | Fullscreen windows cover the background, bottom, and top layers. |
| `overlay` | Fullscreen windows cover every layer, including overlay. |

`top` is the default because it is what most setups want: Waybar and Mako both
default to the top layer, so a fullscreen video hides them, while an on-screen
display or keyboard on the overlay layer still comes through.

Choose `overlay` when nothing at all should interrupt a fullscreen window, and
`none` to keep a bar permanently visible.

Stacking is decided per window, not per output, so a fullscreen window on one
monitor never hides the bar on another.

Two things are always above a fullscreen window regardless of this key: the
session lock screen, and a shown scratchpad or sticky group. A scratchpad is a
window you summon over whatever is playing, so it stays reachable.

With `none`, a fullscreen window is given the usable area rather than the whole
output, so a bar with an exclusive zone does not clip it. The other two values
give it the entire output.

A fullscreen view is always fully opaque, even when a style or window rule
requests lower opacity. A view with opacity below `1.0` cannot use direct
scanout, which presents the application's fullscreen buffer without compositing
it with other content.

Leme does not support drop shadows. For window and workspace animations, see
[animation](animation.md).
